All the folders in this zip file are designed to be opened and run in PyCharm, an open-source IDE for the Python programming language. I have tried and failed to run these scripts in other Python environments, and I have not looked into why. For these scripts to function as intended, they should be opened and run in the PyCharm environment.

To download the PyCharm environment, follow this link:
